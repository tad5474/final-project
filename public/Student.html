      <p><b> Nature Inn</b></p>
        <p2>This nature-based inn is unlike anything in the PA parks system. Everything in and around the beautiful building was designed and built with the environment in mind. Guests can enjoy all that Bald Eagle State Park has to offer – or just sit and watch the birds from a private balcony. Visit their website to find out everything you need to know about Nature Inn.

        <p> <b>Tailgate </b></p>
          <p2> Go find the greek life tailgates or a family tailgate. Personally I suggest finding a family tailgate because they have free food and drinks. Be careful though always use a red solo cup because the undercover cops will bust you.

        <p> <b>Creamery </b></p>
          <p2>The line might be long but its a perfet way to cool off. Everyone knows the Creamery has the very best ice cream in Pennsylvania and beyond. Whether you’re in State College for the day or putting down roots for a lifetime, a one-size-fits-all cone or cup of your favorite Creamery flavor is a bucket list imperative.

        <p> <b>Fraternity Pregames </b></p>
